# Random Color (UIKit)

This project is based off Sean Allen's iOS Dev beginner course. This version of the project uses storyboards to create and manage the layout of the application. The app generates a list of 50 random colors. When the user taps on one of the colors, they are sent to a screen that shows the color fullscreen.
